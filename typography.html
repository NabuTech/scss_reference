            <h2>Understanding Typography in Web Design</h2>
            <p>Typography plays a crucial role in web design, affecting readability, user experience, and overall aesthetics. Proper font choices, font sizes, line heights, and spacing contribute to a well-designed and visually appealing website.</p>

            <h2>What We've Done in This Example</h2>
